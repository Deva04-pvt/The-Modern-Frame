        <p>
          Founded in 2010, <strong>The Modern Frame</strong> was born from a
          passion for contemporary art and a desire to create a space where
          artists and art lovers could connect. We started as a small, intimate
          studio in the heart of the city and have since grown into a renowned
          gallery known for curating provocative and inspiring exhibitions.

        <blockquote>
          "Art is not what you see, but what you make others see." - Edgar Degas
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Our mission is to showcase a diverse range of voices in the art world,
          from emerging talents to established masters. We believe art is a
          vital part of our culture, offering new perspectives and fostering
          critical dialogue. Over the years, we have hosted over 50 exhibitions
          and have had the honor of working with hundreds of incredible artists.
